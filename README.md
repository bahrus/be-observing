# be-observing üî≠ [TODO]

Observe properties of peer elements or the host, mostly declaratively.

*be-observing* takes less of a "top-down" approach to binding than traditional frameworks.  It places less emphasis (but certainly not none) on binding exclusively from the (custom element) component container.  Yes, it can do that, but it can also provide for "Democratic Web Component Organisms" where the host container acts as a very thin "Skin Layer" which can be passed a small number of "stimuli" values into.  Inside the body of the web component, we might have a non visible "brain" component that dispatches events.  *be-observing* allows other peer elements within the "body" to receive messages that the brain component emits, without forcing the outer "skin" layer to have to micromanage this all.

# Alternatives

> [!Note]
> An extra thin layer can be applied on top of be-observing, so that the original HTML that is streamed from the server can provide the initial values of the property that *be-observing* observes, and then once that initial handshake is established, lean exclusively on *be-observing* for all subsequent updates.  This is handled by [be-entrusting](https://github.com/bahrus/be-entrusting).

> [!Note]
> *be-observing* is very close to [be-calculating](https://github.com/bahrus/be-calculating) as far as feature set.  The two share many common modules.  The significant differences are: 
> 1.  *be-calculating* only accepts one "statement" of observables, and hands everything over to JavaScript at that point.  
> 2.  A single *be-observing* enhancement, in contrast, is much more declarative.  It can work with multiple statements / grouped dependencies and provides more avenues to avoid requiring a scripting expression to go along with it, resorting to script expressions as a last resort.
> ~3.  *be-calculating* is a little more vocal, emitting public events from the adorned element, which frameworks or local script handlers can subscribe to and engage with.  *be-observing* is more "introverted".~  
 

> [!Note]
> If you need full two-way binding, consider using [be-bound](https://github.com/bahrus/be-bound).


## The most quintessential example

The example below follows the traditional "pass props down" from the host approach, only really it is "pulling props in". You say tomƒÅto, I say tom√§to kind of thing.

```html
<mood-stone>
    #shadow
    <input 
        name=isHappy 
        disabled 
        type=checkbox  
        be-observing>
</mood-stone>
```

What this does:  Observes and one-way passes *mood-stone*'s isHappy property value to the input element's checked property.

be-observing is making a few inferences:  

1.  The name of the input element ("isHappy") will match with the name of the host property from which we would want to bind it.  Why adopt confusing mappings if we can possibly avoid it? 
2.  Since the type of input element is of type checkbox, it sets the local "checked" property to match the "isHappy" property from the host. 



> [!Note]
> *be-observing* is a rather lengthy word to have to type over and over again, and this element enhancement would likely be sprinkled around quite a bit in a web application.  The name is registered in the optional file [emc.js](https://github.com/bahrus/be-observing/blob/baseline/emc.js) so to use whatever name makes sense to you (üî≠, be-obs?) within your application, just don't reference that file, and instead create and reference your own registration file.  Names can also be overridden within a [Shadow scope](https://github.com/bahrus/be-hive) as well.  Throughout much of the rest of this document, we will use üî≠ instead of be-observing, and ask that you make a "mental map" of üî≠ to "be-observing".  In fact, this package does provide an alternative registration file, üî≠.js, that registers the enhancement via attribute "üî≠".  The developer could easily copy/modify an additional registration file, to adopt their own preferred name.

If you only use this enhancement once in a large application, spelling out the full name (and referencing the canonical emc.js file) would probably make the most sense, for "locality of behavior" reasons, and also tapping into google searches.  But I would strongly consider using a (custom) shortcut in any application that intends to rely on this enhancement in a heavy way.

## Back to our quintessential example

As we already discussed, in the example above, we made the assumption that if the user gives the input element name "isHappy", that the choice of name will most likely match the identical property name coming from the host web component container.

If this assumption doesn't hold in some cases, then we can specify the name of the property we want to observe from the host:

## Specifying the host property to observe

```html
<mood-stone>
    #shadow
    <input 
        type=checkbox 
        disabled 
        be-observing='of /isHappy.'
    >
</mood-stone>
```

Now that we've spelled out the full, canonical name twice (*be-observing*), from now on, we will use "üî≠" as our shortcut for "be-observing", but please apply the mental mapping from üî≠ to the full name, for the statements to make the most sense.  

The slash ("/") symbol indicates to get the value from the host.  If omitted, it is assumed:

## Reducing cryptic syntax

```html
<mood-stone>
    #shadow
    <input 
        type=checkbox 
        disabled 
        üî≠=isHappy
    >
</mood-stone>
```

## Hosts that do not use shadow DOM.

If Shadow DOM is not used, add the "itemscope" attribute so that *be-observing* knows what to look for:

```html
<mood-stone itemscope>
    <input 
        type=checkbox 
        disabled 
        üî≠=isHappy
    >
</mood-stone>
```

## Binding based on microdata attribute.

```html
<mood-stone>
    <template shadowrootmode=open>
        <div itemscope>
            <span üî≠ itemprop=isHappy ></span>
        </div>

        <xtal-element
            prop-defaults='{
                "isHappy": true
            }'
        ></xtal-element>
        <be-hive></be-hive>
    </template>
</mood-stone>
```

This sets the span's textContent to the .toString value of mood-stone's isHappy property, and monitors for changes, i.e. one-way binds.

*xtal-element*, by the way, is a [userland implementation](https://github.com/bahrus/xtal-element) of declarative custom elements, so the example above is actually fully functional (after importing two generic js references).

## By Id also works:

```html
<mood-stone>
    <template shadowrootmode=open>
        <div itemscope>
            <span itemprop=isHappy></span>
        </div>
        <input 
            id=isHappy 
            disabled 
            type=checkbox  
            üî≠
        >
        <xtal-element
            prop-defaults='{
                "isHappy": true
            }'
            xform='{
                "| isHappy": 0
            }'
        ></xtal-element>
        <be-hive></be-hive>
    </template>
</mood-stone>
```

Note that the itemprop attribute takes precedence over the name attribute, which takes precedence over the id attribute.

In the example above, we are mixing inline binding (üî≠) with binding from a distance ("xform").

## DSS Specifier Syntax

In the example above, we mentioned using the / symbol to indicate to observe a property from the host.  But be-observing can also observe peer elements within the ShadowRoot (or outside any shadow root *be-observing* adorns an element sitting outside any ShadowRoot).

The syntax adopts what we refer to as the DSS specification, where DSS stands for "directed scoped specifier".  It is inspired by CSS selectors, but it is optimized for binding scenarios. 

This is documented in (increasingly) painstaking detail where the [DSS parser library is maintained](https://github.com/bahrus/trans-render/blob/baseline/dss/README.md#directed-scoped-specifiers-dss).




## Example 1d  Negation [TODO]

```html
<mood-stone>
    #shadow
    <input type=checkbox disabled üî≠='isVegetarian and set to !.'>
</mood-stone>
```
<!--
## Example 1e Translation 

```html
<mood-stone>
    #shadow
    <input type=readonly be-observing-of='age - 20.'>
</mood-stone>
```

Can also use addition (+), multiplication (*), division (/) [Untested].

-->

## Binding to peer elements

Now we will start to see how be-observing provides for more "grass-roots" democratic organism (web component) support.

## By name attribute

```html
<input name=search type=search>

<div üî≠=@search></div>
```

As the user types in the input field, the div's text content reflects the value that was typed.

The search for the element with name=search is done within the closest form element, and if not found, within the (shadow)root node.

## By id

This also works:

```html
<input id=searchString type=search>

<div üî≠=#searchString></div>
```

The search for element with id=searchString is done within the (shadow)root node, since id's are supposed to be unique with a (shadow)root node.

## By markers

```html
<mood-stone>
    #shadow
    <my-peer-element -some-bool-prop></my-peer-element>
    <input 
        type=checkbox 
        disabled 
        üî≠=-some-bool-prop
    >
</mood-stone>
```

This observes the my-peer-element's someBoolProp property for changes and sets the adorned element's checked property based on the current value.

## By itemprop

```html
<data value=true itemprop=isHappy hidden></data>

...

<input
    disabled
    type=checkbox 
    üî≠=|isHappy
>
```

What this does:  It watches for changes to the value attribute of the data element, and parses the value using JSON.parse and passes the value to the checked property of the input element.

We saw earlier that we can adorn elements with the itemprop attribute with the üî≠ attribute, and it will automatically pull in values from the host.  This allows us to create a code-free "chain" of bindings from the host to Shadow children, and from the Shadow children to peer elements.

# Specifying the property to assign the observed value(s) to.

What we've seen above is a lot of mind reading about what our intentions are, as far as how we want to apply what we are observing to the element adorned by *be-observing*.  Sometimes we are setting the "checked" property.  Sometimes we are setting the textContent.  

But sometimes we need to be more explicit because it isn't always transparent what we intend.

## Single mapping from what to observe, specifying the property to target.

```html
<input name=someCheckbox type=checkbox>

<mood-stone 
    enh-üî≠='of @someCheckbox and set isHappy.'
    >
</mood-stone>

```

This watches the input element for input events and passes the checked property to the isHappy property of oMoodStone.  

The enh- prefix is there to avoid possible conflicts with attributes recognized by my-peer-element, in the absence of any [tender loving care from the platform](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/1000).

> [!NOTE]
> This potentially could allow for a xss attack.  For that reason, *be-observing* blocks setting innerHTML to an arbitrary string [TODO].

<!-- ```html
<input name=someCheckbox type=checkbox>

<my-peer-element enh-üî≠='
    and set someBoolProp from @someCheckbox.
    '></my-peer-element>

``` -->

## Multiple parallel observers

This example works, where each observing statement is treated independently:

```html
<input name=someCheckbox type=checkbox>
<input name=someOtherCheckbox type=checkbox>

<mood-stone
    enh-üî≠="of @someCheckbox and set isHappy.
            Of @someOtherCheckbox and set isWealthy."
'>
    <template shadowrootmode=open>
        <div itemscope>
            is happy
            <div itemprop=isHappy></div>
            is wealthy
            <div itemprop=isWealthy></div>
        </div>
        <xtal-element infer-props
            prop-defaults='{
                "isHappy": true,
                "isWealthy": false
            }'
            xform='{
                "| isHappy": 0,
                "| isWealthy": 0
            }'
        ></xtal-element>
        <be-hive></be-hive>
    </template>
</mood-stone>
```


## Many to 1

If multiple remote endpoints are observed that map to a single local prop, by default, the "truthy" conjunction (&&) is applied to them all:

```html
<input name=someCheckbox type=checkbox>
<input name=someOtherCheckbox type=checkbox>

<mood-stone 
    enh-üî≠='of @someCheckbox and @someOtherCheckbox and set isHappy.'
>
    <template shadowrootmode=open>
        <div itemscope>
            is happy
            <div itemprop=isHappy></div>
        </div>
        <xtal-element 
            prop-defaults='{
                "isHappy": true,
            }'
            xform='{
                "| isHappy": 0,
            }'
        ></xtal-element>
        <be-hive></be-hive>
    </template>
</mood-stone>
```

In other words, in this example, the *mood-stone*'s "isHappy" property will be set to true only if both checkboxes are checked, otherwise it will be set to false.

The number of things we can observe is limited only by when the developer tires of typing the word "and".

*be-observing* also supports additional ways of combining multiple remote endpoints into one local prop.

They are:

1.  Union [Untested]

```html
<mood-stone enh-üî≠='of @someCheckbox and @someOtherCheckbox and set isHappy to ||.'>
```

2.  Sum [Untested]

```html
<mood-stone enh-üî≠='of @someNumericInput and @someOtherNumericInput and set mySum to +.'>
```

3.  Product [Untested]

<mood-stone enh-üî≠='of @someNumericInput and @someOtherNumericInput and set myProduct to *.'>

4.  Interpolation [TODO -- wait for sanitizer api or whatever it is called these days to finally land in all the browsers]

<mood-stone enh-üî≠='of @name and @food and set sentenceProp to `${0} eats ${1}`.'>

5.  Object Assignment [Untested]

<mood-stone 
    enh-üî≠='of @name and @food and set myObjectProp to {}.'>

## Observing a single remote endpoint and applying a simple mapping to the value [TODO]

```html
<input type=checkbox name=isHappy>

```html
<input type=checkbox name=isHappy>

<div üî≠="of @isHappy and be joyous if true and be melancholy if false and be ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø if neither."></div>
```

The statement above uses toString on @isHappy if not null.  If it is null or doesn't match any of the other tests, sets to the else.

*-be is kind of like the map function of JS.  If *-of is observing more than one 

## Being boolish [TODO]

To use truthy checks:

```html
<input name=search>

<div 
    üî≠="of @search and be Searching\.\.\. if truthy and otherwise be How can I help you today?." 
>
</div>
```

## Many to many

So far we've seen 1-1 correspondences and many to 1.  The question is -- Is many to many too complex to express with English?  Is this a scenario where JavaScript is a must?


```html
<input name=search>
<input type=checkbox name=feelingLucky>

<div 
    üî≠="of @search and be Searching\.\.\. if truthy and otherwise be How can I help you today?." 
>
</div>
```



# For the power hungry JS-firsters [TODO]

We can write custom JS expressions, and integrate it with our observing statements.

## Locally defined

```html
<div id="hZs4GGd8EWxoIxPYAnpQA">
    <input id=searchString type=search>

    <div defer-üî≠ üî≠='#searchString and punt.'></div>
    <script üèá-on=üî≠>document.currentScript.e = 
        e => e.target.textContent = e.args[0] + ' World';
    <script>
</div>
```


*be-observing* fires an event from the adorned element whose name matches the current name of the enhancement attribute base ('üî≠' in this case).  Anyone can subscribe and have a say on what happens then.  The markup below relies on a separate enhancement, [be-eventing](https://github.com/bahrus/be-eventing).  Other ways of attaching the event handler will also work (subject to delicate timing issues), such as from a framework or custom element host.

What this does:  It sets the div's textContent property to the value of searchString input element, after appending the word "World".

## Globally defined

```html
<script type=module>
    import {register} from 'be-observing/üî≠.js';
    register('appendWorld', e => e.r = e.args[0] + ' World');
</script>
<input id=searchString type=search>

<div üî≠='of #searchString and set to appendWorld.'></div>
```



## Attaching and setting other enhancement values [TODO]

```html
<input name=search type=search>

<div üî≠='
    @search and set +beSearching?.forText.
'>
    supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
</div>
```

The plus symbol:  + is indicating to tap into a [custom enhancement](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/1000).

The example above happens to refer to this [enhancement](https://github.com/bahrus/be-searching).

## Observing a specified property of a peer custom element [TODO]

```html
<tr itemscope>
    <td>
        <my-item-view-model></my-item-view-model>
        <div üî≠="~myItemViewModel?.myProp1.">My First column information</div>
    </td>
    <td>
        <div üî≠="of ~myItemViewModel?.myProp2."></div>
    </td>
</tr>
```

The search for the my-item-view-model custom element is done within the closest "itemscope" attribute.

This can be useful for scenarios where we want to display repeated data, and can't use a custom element to host each repeated element (for example, rows of an HTML table), but we want to provide a custom element as the "view model" for each row.

This will one-way synchronize *my-item-view-model*'s myProp 1/2 values to the adorned element's textContent property.

## Inferring the property to observe from a peer custom element

This also works: [TODO]

```html
<tr itemscope>
    <td>
        <my-item-view-model></my-item-view-model>
        <div itemprop=myProp1 üî≠="~myItemViewModel.">My First column information</div>
    </td>
    <td>
        <div itemprop=myProp2 üî≠="~myItemViewModel."></div>
    </td>
</tr>
```

We can specify what property of the peer custom element to bind to as follows:





## Toggle [TODO]

To simply toggle a property anytime the observed element changes:

```html
<mood-stone>
    #shadow
    
    <input name=someCheckbox type=checkbox>

    <my-peer-element enh-üî≠='@someCheckbox::input and toggle someBoolProp.
        '></my-peer-element>
</mood-stone>
```

## PlusEq, MinusEq, TimeEq, DivEq [TODO]

## Increment, Decrement [TODO]



## Interpolating [TODO]

```html
<mood-stone>
    #shadow
    
    <input name=name>
    <input name=food>

    <my-peer-element enh-üî≠='
        @name and @food and set mySecondProp to `$1 eats $2`.
        '></my-peer-element>
</mood-stone>
```


## Adding / removing css classes / styles / parts declaratively [TODO]

```html
<mood-stone>
    #shadow
    
    <input name=yourCheckbox type=checkbox>
    <input name=myCheckbox type=checkbox>

    <my-peer-element enh-üî≠='
        @yourCheckbox and set-class my-class.
        And @myCheckbox and set-class my-second-class.
        '></my-peer-element>
</mood-stone>
```

Since we are binding to booleans, adds class if true, otherwise removes.

If we bind to a string, simply sets the class to the value of the string.

Same with SetPart, SetStyle

## Observing a specified property [TODO]

```html
<my-peer-element></my-peer-element>

<your-peer-element enh-üî≠="~myPeerElement?.myProp and set yourProp.
">
```

This will one-way synchronize *my-peer-element*'s myProp value to the adorned element's yourProp property.

## Example 5 Mapping [TODO]

## Example 6

> [!Note]
> *be-observing* provides similar functionality to [be-bound](https://github.com/bahrus/be-bound).  The difference is *be-bound* provides *two-way binding* between the adorned element and an upstream element, whereas be-observing is strictly one-way.  Because it is one way, be-observing can apply some declarative adjustments to the value it is observing before applying to the adorned element.
